# Healthcare-Operations-Dashboard-
Develop healthcare analytics dashboard using Python and Power BI to Improved operational workflows, reporting clarity, and KPI monitoring to support data-driven decisions.

## Project Overview
As part of a strategic team project for the **Al-Baha Health Cluster**, I developed a comprehensive Healthcare Analytics Dashboard. This project focuses on the intersection of **IT Infrastructure** and **Data Governance** to improve operational efficiency and patient care management within the cluster.

##  Key Objectives
- **Data-Driven Decisions:** Transitioning from manual reporting to automated, real-time insights.
- **Operational Excellence:** Identifying bottlenecks in healthcare delivery and optimizing workflows.
- **KPI Monitoring:** Tracking critical health metrics (KPIs) to align with national healthcare standards and Vision 2030.

## Tech Stack & Tools
| Category | Tools |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Analysis** | Python (Pandas, NumPy), SQL |
| **Visualization** | Power BI |
| **Data Management** | ETL Process, Data Cleaning |
| **Compliance** | NDMO Standards, Data Privacy Principles |

## Key Features & Contributions
- **Automated Reporting:** Streamlined data collection processes to reduce manual errors.
- **Interactive Dashboards:** Built dynamic visuals to monitor patient flow, bed occupancy, and staff performance.
- **Data Governance & Integrity:** Implemented strict data cleaning protocols to ensure the accuracy of sensitive health information.
- **Stakeholder Clarity:** Improved reporting clarity for directors and decision-makers to support evidence-based planning.

##  Impact & Results
The dashboard serves as a vital tool for the Al-Baha Health Cluster by providing:
1. **Faster Response:** Real-time visibility into operational issues.
2. **High Accuracy:** Reliable data for KPI reporting and audits.
3. **Optimized Resources:** Better distribution of medical staff and equipment based on actual data.

##  Data Governance Note
> This project adheres to **NDMO** (National Data Management Office) guidelines. All sensitive healthcare data has been anonymized, and the repository contains only architectural frameworks and sample visualizations to ensure patient privacy.
